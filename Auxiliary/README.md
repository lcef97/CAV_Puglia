## Auxiliary material

#### Auxiliary R functions
[This file](https://github.com/lcef97/CAV_Puglia/blob/main/Auxiliary/Functions.R)
includes the main R functions called in the markdown or R scripts.
As long as the project depended on a small number of function a separate file/repo 
was not necessary, but as things are getting complex this seemed the better way. 
More functions are going to be moved here, in order to make scripts like
[CAV_full](https://github.com/lcef97/CAV_Puglia/blob/main/CAV_full.R) shorter, clearer and more readable.

## Peripheral branch

This is a peripheral repository of the working directory and is meant to host miscellaneous files.
At the time being the main file is [this one](https://github.com/lcef97/CAV_Puglia/blob/main/Other/NC_sids_application.pdf),
a short note/report/vignette showing the \textit{attempt} to implement a sparse-precision parametrisation
of the BYM model. For brevity I apply the model to the SIDS dataset, which is relatively small, easy to handle and 
well known to most researchers in this field.
